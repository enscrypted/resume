## About

My name is Ken Mills and I am a Computer Science student at the University of Akron. Before Akron, I had also studied Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois in Chicago, Fashion Design at Kent State University, and Graphic/Web Design at Lorain County Community College. I have created successful ecommerce businesses, and currently run a carpentry business called Commander Care Home Services I founded with my father. I tend to enjoy projects that are complex and math-heavy and prefer a minimalistic development environment (notepad and command line when feasible). I am very dedicated to my family, both blood and chosen, who are also my biggest supporters.  


## Interests

My main fields of interests lie in security, embedded systems, and robotics.

For security, I study both network and systems security, and my ideal job lies in either of these sectors.

I also enjoy writing code for embedded systems, mainly in C. Things such as home security systems, daily task automation, and some niche projects are all programs I've either written or plan to write.

Robotics is a field that I have not had much practice in, yet fascinates me. Research into the field and robotics content I regularly enjoy have convinced me this would be a great field to be involved in.

## Hobbies

Aside from tech, there are many other things I enjoy.

I enjoy creating art of all varieties. I primarily focus on video composition and graphic design, but I also enjoy painting, music production, and mixed-media arts

I practice snowboarding, BMX biking, skateboarding, and free climbing as often as possible. These sports used to encompass a majority of my time, but I have found less and less time over the years to participate. However, I still take up any opportunity I can to ride

I am an avid player of video games and enjoy a wide variety. My three favorite genres are First Person Shooters, MMORPGs, and Single Player RPGS. My favorite title in each of these genres are CoD: Modern Warfare 2, RuneScape, and Dark Souls 2
